# VisionArduinoWorkshop-project-3
This is the prototype circuit for automatic street light project. 
Analog input is fed to the arduino uno and value obtained is compared with gardcoded value. Atabove or below a threshold value a output is trigerred which will result in firing of 5v mechanical relay.
In this circuit output of the relay is connected to a LED and a battery.
